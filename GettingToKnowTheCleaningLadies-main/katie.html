<h2> Introduction </h2>

    I was born in Munster Indiana but I currently live in Palos Heights IL, which has a fun little 30 to 40 minute commute to Lewis everyday. 
    I am vice president of the VR club here at Lewis and I have lots of fun getting people to interact with new technology.
    I am going to turn 21 this semester and I am very excited to be a legal adult not banned from half the businesses in the US
    based on my age! :) I just purchased a new motercycle in November (the worst time to get a bike) and I am so excited to ride in the summer.
    I currently work at UPS, but unfortunetly suffered a permanent hand injury in both hands last May. I have many full-blood,
    half-blood, and step siblings. My dream is to one day as soon as possible have my own place to live.




<h3> What I Hope To Learn In This Course: </h3>



<ul style="list-style-type:square;">

 <li>Different Code Languages</li>

 <li>A fully developed piece of software</li>

 <li>How to be a professional engineer</li>

 <li>How to get a useable piece of software</li>

 <li>Creating a project for  my resume to get a job</li>

</ul>



<h4> My Favorite Hobby </h4>

 
My favorite hobby is working out. I actually get this at work. I work at UPS. I try to get in my workout and get paid for it. I used
to be a powerlifter, but I do not have time at all during college. I want to be a strong and healthy indivdual. SO whenever I can be active
I am active!





<h5> Fun Fact About Me! </h5>
